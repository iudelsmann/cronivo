# Cronivo
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iudelsmann/cronivo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iudelsmann/cronivo)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/iudelsmann/cronivo/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/iudelsmann/cronivo)

Synced job scheduler for node using [later](https://bunkat.github.io/later/) and [Redis](http://redis.js.org/).
Used to synchronize scheduled job executions in cluster or multiprocess.

## Installation
Use npm to download and install.
```bash
npm install cronivo --save
```

## Usage
Cronivo is very simple to use, it is complementary to later, requiring later to be used to create schedules, and redis to create clients.

### Scheduling jobs

To create recurring jobs use:

```js
const redis = require('redis');
const Cronivo = require('cronivo');
const later = require('later');

const redisClient = redis.createClient();
const cronivo = new Cronivo(redisClient);

// Create a schedule any way you like using later
const schedule = later.parse.recur().every(5).second();

// Schedule recurring execution
cronivo.addJob(myFunc, schedule, 'job1');

function myFunc() {
    console.log('I was executed only once')
}
```

To create a single execution job, use:

```js
const redis = require('redis');
const Cronivo = require('cronivo');
const later = require('later');

const redisClient = redis.createClient();
const cronivo = new Cronivo(redisClient);

// Create a schedule any way you like using later
const schedule = later.parse.recur().every(5).second();

// Schedule single execution
cronivo.addSingleExecutionJob(myFunc, schedule, 'job1');

function myFunc() {
    console.log('I was executed only once')
}
```

**The job name must be unique, since it will be used as a key in redis. If you are changing a job's schedule you might need to erase it's data from redis to avoid wrong execution**

### Cancelling jobs

To cancel jobs simply use:

```js
cronivo.cancelJob('job1')
```

This will avoid new executions and erase all data that was stored in redis. If the job does not exists, it will not throw an error, nor erase any data from redis

### Forcing execution

You can also execute a job immeditely, which will not affect the scheduled instances:

```js
cronivo.runJob('job1');
```

## Logging

Cronivo logs job errors to the console by default, you can provide a custom logger through the constructor:

```js
const redis = require('redis');
const Cronivo = require('cronivo');

// Custom logger, could be any other that implements info error debug
const logger = require('winston');

const redisClient = redis.createClient();
const cronivo = new Cronivo(redisClient, logger);
```
